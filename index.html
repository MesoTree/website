<h1>MesoTree</h1>
<p>
Project to document the morphosyntax of five endangered languages in areal contact. The proposed project 
will use the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework to produce annotated corpora that (1) are easily searchable 
by linguists, (2) are annotated in a way that is aligned with corpora in hundreds of the world's language, 
enabling comparative syntactic research, and (3) lend themselves to training automatic annotation tools 
via machine learning techniques. The project will contribute significant advances in language documentation 
and syntactic research by providing endangered-language datasets that are publicly accessible and usable to 
linguists and language technologists, producing methods that facilitate future language documentation efforts 
and open up new avenues of quantitative syntactic investigation.
